    "## The Amor beamline\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can load the data, we need to define the parameters of the beamline and briefly discuss the measurement philosophy.\n",
    "We begin by defining the convention for naming angles in our set-up.\n",
    "We use the Fig. 5 from the paper by [Stahn & Glavic (2016)](#stahn2016), which is reproduced below (along with its caption).\n",

    "![Figure5](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0168900216300250-gr5.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The yellow area shows the incoming and reflected beam, both with the divergence $\\Delta \\theta$.\n",
    "The inclination of the sample relative to the centre of the incoming beam (here identical to the instrument horizon) is called $\\omega$, and the respective angle of the reflected beam relative to the same axis is $\\gamma$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general the detector centre is located at $\\gamma_{\\rm D} = 2\\omega$.\n",
    "These are instrument coordinates and should not be confused with the situation on the sample, where the take-off angle of an individual neutron trajectory is called $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The supermirror reference\n",
    "\n",
    "The normalization of data from the Amor instrument in divergent mode requires a reference measurement of a neutron supermirror.\n",
    "The supermirror is not a perfect supermirror, and is described with some properties, an $m$-value, a critical edge, and an $\\alpha$, from which we can calibrate the supermirror. \n",
    "This reference measurement facilitates two normalizations on our data:\n",
    "- normalization of neutron count per unit time, assuming that the instrument flux is constant between the supermirror measurement and our sample measurement,\n",
    "- normalization over the detector pixels, to account for differences in pixel efficiency.\n",
    "It is important when this normalization is performed that the differences in count time and beam footprint are accounted for such that the measurements are commensurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `amor` module provides a helper function that generates the default beamline parameters.\n",
    "This function requires the sample rotation angle ($\\omega$) as an input to fully define the beamline.\n",
    "In the future, all these beamline parameters (including the sample rotation) will be included in the file meta data.\n",
    "For now, we must define this manually, and the rotation is different for the sample and reference files."
