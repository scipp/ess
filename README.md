# ess

European Spallation Source facility bespoke, neutron scattering tools based on
[scipp](https://github.com/scipp/scipp).
This is a collection of python tools providing facility and instrument specific support
for the ESS.

This supersedes scripts in [ess-legacy](https://github.com/scipp/ess-legacy)

This is built on and complemented by neutron and technique specific support available in
[scippneutron](https://github.com/scipp/scippneutron).
