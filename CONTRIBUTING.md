## Contributing to ESS

Welcome to the developer side of the ESS data reduction packages!

Contributions are always welcome.
This includes reporting bugs or other issues, submitting pull requests, requesting new features, etc.

If you need help with using these packages or contributing to them, have a look at the GitHub [discussions](https://github.com/scipp/ess/discussions) and start a new [Q&A discussion](https://github.com/scipp/ess/discussions/categories/q-a) if you can't find what you are looking for.

For bug reports and other problems, please open an [issue](https://github.com/scipp/ess/issues/new) in GitHub.

You are welcome to submit pull requests at any time.
But to avoid having to make large modifications during review or even have your PR rejected, please first open an issue first to discuss your idea!

Check out the developer documentation for the relevant package for details on how it is developed.
