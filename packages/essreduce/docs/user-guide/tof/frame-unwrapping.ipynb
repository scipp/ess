    "At time-of-flight neutron sources recording event-mode, time-stamps of detected neutrons are written to files in an `NXevent_data` group.\n",
    "This contains two main time components, `event_time_zero` and `event_time_offset`.\n",
    "The sum of the two would typically yield the absolute detection time of the neutron.\n",
    "For computation of wavelengths or energies during data-reduction, a time-of-flight is required.\n",
    "In principle the time-of-flight could be equivalent to `event_time_offset`, and the emission time of the neutron to `event_time_zero`.\n",
    "Since an actual computation of time-of-flight would require knowledge about chopper settings, detector positions, and whether the scattering of the sample is elastic or inelastic, this may however not be the case in practice.\n",
    "Instead, the data acquisition system may, e.g., record the time at which the proton pulse hits the target as `event_time_zero`, with `event_time_offset` representing the offset since then.\n",
    "\n",
    "We refer to the process of \"unwrapping\" these time stamps into an actual time-of-flight as *frame unwrapping*, since `event_time_offset` \"wraps around\" with the period of the proton pulse and neutrons created by different proton pulses may be recorded with the *same* `event_time_zero`.\n",
    "The figures in the remainder of this document will clarify this."
