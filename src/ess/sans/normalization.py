    Solid angle computed from rectangular pixels with a 'width' and a 'height'.

        The solid angle of the detector pixels, as viewed from the sample position.

    Compute the denominator term for the I(Q) normalization. This is basically:

    If the solid angle is not supplied, it is assumed to be 1.
    If the direct beam is not supplied, it is assumed to be 1.

    Because the multiplication between the wavelength dependent terms (monitor counts)
    and the pixel dependent term (solid angle) consists of a broadcast operation which
    would introduce correlations, we strip the data of variances.
    It is the responsibility of the user to ensure that the variances are small enough
    that they can be ignored. See more details in Heybrock et al. (2023).

    Parameters

    direct_transmission_monitor:

    direct_beam:
