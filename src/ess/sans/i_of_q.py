    Prepare monitor data for computing the transmission fraction.
    The input data are first converted to wavelength (if needed).
    If a ``non_background_range`` is provided, it defines the region where data is
    considered not to be background, and regions outside are background. A mean
    background level will be computed from the background and will be subtracted from
    the non-background counts.
    Finally, if wavelength bins are provided, the data is rebinned to match the
    requested binning.

    Parameters
    ----------
    monitor:
        The monitor (or group of monitors) to be pre-processed.
    wavelength_bins:
        The binning in wavelength to use for the rebinning.
    non_background_range:
        The range of wavelengths that defines the data which does not constitute
        background. Everything outside this range is treated as background counts.

    Compute the scattering cross-section I(Q) for a SANS experimental run, performing

    The main steps of the workflow are:

    * Generate a coordinate transformation graph from ``tof`` to ``Q``, that also
      includes ``wavelength``.
    * Convert the detector data to wavelength.
    * Compute the transmission fraction from the monitor data.
    * Compute the solid angles of the detector pixels.
    * Resample the direct beam function to the same wavelength binning as the
      monitors.
    * Combine solid angle, direct beam, transmission fraction and incident monitor
      counts to compute the denominator for the normalization.
    * Convert the detector data to momentum vector Q.
    * Convert the denominator to momentum vector Q.
    * Normalize the detector data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data:
        The detector data. This can be both events or dense (histogrammed) data.
    data_monitors:
        The data arrays for the incident and transmission monitors for the measurement
        run (background noise removed and converted to wavelength).
    direct_monitors:
        The data arrays for the incident and transmission monitors for the direct
        run (background noise removed and converted to wavelength).
    direct_beam:
        The direct beam function of the instrument (histogrammed,
        depends on wavelength).
    wavelength_bins:
        The binning in the wavelength dimension to be used.
    q_bins:
        The binning in the Q dimension to be used.
    gravity:
        Include the effects of gravity when computing the scattering angle if ``True``.
    wavelength_mask:
        Mask to apply to the wavelength coordinate (to mask out artifacts from the
        instrument beamline). See :func:`common.mask_range` for more details.
    wavelength_bands:
        If defined, return the data as a set of bands in the wavelength dimension. This
        is useful for separating different wavelength ranges that contribute to
        different regions in Q space.
    signal_over_monitor_threshold:
        The threshold for the ratio of detector counts to monitor counts above which
        an error is raised because it is not safe to drop the variances of the monitor.

    Returns
    -------
